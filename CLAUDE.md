Default to using Bun instead of Node.js.

- Use `bun <file>` instead of `node <file>` or `ts-node <file>`
- Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `vitest`
- Use `bun build <file.html|file.ts|file.css>` instead of `webpack` or `esbuild`
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>` or `yarn run <script>` or `pnpm run <script>`
- Use `bunx <package> <command>` instead of `npx <package> <command>`
- Bun automatically loads .env, so don't use dotenv.

## APIs

- `Bun.serve()` supports WebSockets, HTTPS, and routes. Don't use `express`.
- `bun:sqlite` for SQLite. Don't use `better-sqlite3`.
- `Bun.redis` for Redis. Don't use `ioredis`.
- `Bun.sql` for Postgres. Don't use `pg` or `postgres.js`.
- `WebSocket` is built-in. Don't use `ws`.
- Prefer `Bun.file` over `node:fs`'s readFile/writeFile
- Bun.$`ls` instead of execa.

## Testing

Use `bun test` to run tests.

```ts#index.test.ts
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("hello world", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

## Frontend

Use HTML imports with `Bun.serve()`. Don't use `vite`. HTML imports fully support React, CSS, Tailwind.

## Three Man Team

- Roles run in human-started sessions. Do not auto-spawn a role unless the Project Owner explicitly asks.
- Role personas live only in `ARCHITECT.md`, `BUILDER.md`, `REVIEWER.md`, `ROGER.md`, and optional `OPERATOR.md`.
- Before role work, read only that role file and its required handoff files.
- Handoff files overwrite each step except `handoff/BUILD-LOG.md`, which is append-only.
- Bob runs tests on final post-review-fix state and records commands and results in `handoff/BUILD-LOG.md` and `handoff/REVIEW-REQUEST.md`.
- Richard and Roger do not run tests unless Alice or the Project Owner explicitly directs it. They review code and Bob's recorded results.
- Alice confirms reported green state still matches commit state at deploy gate. If code changed after Bob's report, Alice runs tests once.

## Operator

- Oz is optional. Use `OPERATOR.md` only after its environment coordinates are filled from observed facts.
- Oz does not write repository code. Oz writes operational reports and performs only actions allowed by `OPERATOR.md` tiers.
